# Image Captioning

This repository contains an implementation of the "Show, Attend, and Tell" model for generating descriptive captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms.

## Features

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Utilizes a CNN to encode image features and an RNN with attention to decode these features into coherent textual descriptions.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Employs attention to focus on specific regions of an image during caption generation, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the captions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- NumPy
- NLTK
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janajaber/ImageCaptioning.git
   cd ImageCaptioning
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [Flickr8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k), which consists of 8,000 images, each annotated with five different captions.

**Download and Prepare the Dataset**:

1. Download the dataset and place the images in a directory named `Images`.
2. Ensure the captions file is named `captions.txt` and is located in the root directory of the project.

## Training

To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir ./Images --captions_file captions.txt --epochs 20 --batch_size 64
```
Adjust the parameters as needed.

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance using the BLEU metric:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path ./models/best_model.pth --data_dir ./Images --captions_file captions.txt
```

## Inference

Generate captions for new images:
```bash
python inference.py --model_path ./models/best_model.pth --image_path ./path_to_your_image.jpg
```

## Results

The model achieved a BLEU-4 score of 9.76% on the Flickr8k dataset. This performance is lower than models trained on larger datasets like MS COCO, primarily due to the limited size of the Flickr8k dataset and resource constraints. Additionally, while the BLEU metric is commonly used, it has limitations as it focuses on n-gram overlap and may not fully capture the semantic meaning of the generated captions.
